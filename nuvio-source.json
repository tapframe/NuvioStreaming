Please expect bugs and limitations:  \n- Embedded subtitle support is **not available** yet, as KSPlayer is a custom React Native module.  \n- Use **external/addon subtitles** for now until proper support is added.  \n\n---\n\n⚠️ **Important:** Both **iOS and Android users** are requested to update to this version to continue receiving future **OTA updates**.",
